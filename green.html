<h1>About Green Energy</h1>
<p>Green energy is the future. It represents a shift from the environmentally harmful fossil fuels of the past and presents a way forward that benefits everyone. Collecting from a wide range of natural processes, from wind to water and geothermal to biofuel, it characterizes a massive, relatively untapped enterprise. The switch away from our current energy sources represents a beacon of hope in the battle against climate change, since green energy, as its name suggests, is fairly environmentally friendly and generally doesnâ€™t release greenhouse gases. It also helps create energy independence, especially on a local scale. Additionally, it has the potential to create countless new jobs and substantially boost numerous economies all across the world. In conclusion, continued investment in this sector will surely prove fruitful, and one of the best ways to get a piece of the pie is through the everyday homeowner to include green energy in their households.</p>
